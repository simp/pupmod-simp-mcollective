SIMP MCollective Deployment Guide
=================================

## Overview and Module Description

The SIMP MCollective module is an extension of
[voxpupuli/puppet-mcollective](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-mcollective).
Like voxpupuli's module, this module conforms to the
[mcollective standard deploymet guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/standard.html),
where appropriate.  This module is most effectively used in conjunction with the
[simp::mcollective stock class](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp/blob/master/manifests/mcollective.pp).

## Setup

MCollective has three primary components: server, client, and middleware.
By default, any node that includes the
[simp::mcollective stock class](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-simp/blob/master/manifests/mcollective.pp)
will include the server and middleware components.

    classes:
      - 'simp::mcollective'

If you want a node to be a client as well, set:

    mcollective::client: true

Disabling the server component follows suit:

    mcollective::server: false

A host of other variables must be set which cannot have reasonable defaults:

    activemq::mq_admin_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    activemq::mq_cluster_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    activemq::manage_config : false
    simp::mcollective::truststore_certificate : '/etc/pki/cacerts/cacerts.pem'
    simp::mcollective::keystore_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    simp::mcollective::truststore_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    mcollective::middleware_admin_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    mcollective::middleware_password : '<foobarbaz>'
    mcollective::middleware_hosts :
      - '<middleware.host.fqdn>'

All remaining variables have reasonable defaults, and are set in:

    ../hieradata/simp/mcollective/default.yaml

## Security

For details about the MCollective security framework, reference the
[MCollective security overview](https://puppetlabs.com/mcollective/security-overview).

Full SSL is enabled in every component of MCollective by default.  PAM and
IPtables support is integrated as well.

This module supports RPC authorization and auditing.  See the
[mcollective-actionpolicy-plugin documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-actionpolicy-auth) for details about creating policies.

## Setting Up A User

All MCollective users must have an x509 keypair, and an RSA public key.
The keypair can be supplied externally or generated with the SIMP FakeCA.
See FakeCA/usergen for more details. Note that in either case, the CA must be
added to the middleware truststore, which is done by default for FakeCA.

Every user must have access to the mcollective public cert, which is auto
generated by mco_autokey.  It resides in:

    /etc/mcollective/ssl/mco_autokeys/mco_public.pem

It is recommended every user's RSA public key be copied to:

    /etc/puppet/environments/simp/keydist/mcollective

This way, public key disribution is automatically managed by Puppet.

Every user needs a .mcollective configuration file.  This file should
only be accessible by the mco user.
