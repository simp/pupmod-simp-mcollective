## Overview

The mcollective module installs, configures, and manages the mcollective
agents, and clients of an MCollective cluster.

## Module Description

The mcollective module handles installing and configuring mcollective across a
range of operating systems and distributions.  Where possible we follow the
standards laid down by the
[MCollective Standard Deployment guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/standard.html).

### MCollective Terminology

A quick aside, mcollective's terminology differs a little from what you might
be used to in puppet.  There are 3 main components, the client (the mco
commands you run to control your servers), the server (a daemon that runs on
all of your managed nodes and executes the commands), and the middleware (a
message broker the servers and agent connect to).

If it helps to map these to puppet concepts you loosely have:

* Middleware -> Puppet Master
* MCollective Server -> Puppet Agent
* MCollective Client -> no direct equivalent


## Setup

### What the mcollective module affects

On a server

* mcollective package
* mcollective server configuration file
* mcollective service

On a client

* mcollective-client package
* mcollective client configuration file
* optionally user configuration files (~/.mcollective and ~/.mcollective.d)

### Beginning with mcollective

Your main entrypoint to the mcollective module is the mcollective class, so
assuming you have your middleware configured on a node this is all you need to
add a server to mcollective.

```puppet
class { '::mcollective':
  middleware_hosts => [ 'broker1.example.com' ],
}
```

## Usage

Your primary interaction with the mcollective module will be though the main
mcollective class, with secondary configuration managed by the defined types
`mcollective::user`, `mcollective::plugin`, `mcollective::actionpolicy`, and
`mcollective::actionpolicy::rule`.

### I just want to run it, what's the minimum I need?

```puppet
node 'broker1.example.com' {
  include activemq
}

node 'server1.example.com' {
  class { '::mcollective':
    middleware_hosts => [ 'broker1.example.com' ],
  }
}

node 'control1.example.com' {
  class { '::mcollective':
    client            => true,
    middleware_hosts => [ 'broker1.example.com' ],
  }
}
```

This default install will be using *no* TLS, a set of well-known usernames and
passwords, and the psk securityprovider.  This is against the recommendataion
of the standard deploy guide but does save you from having to deal with ssl
certificates to begin with.


### I'd like to secure the transport channel and authenticate users, how do I do that?

Gather some credentials for the server and users.  You'll need the ca
certificate, and a keypair for the server to use, and a keypair for each user
to allow.

See the [standard deploy guide](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/standard.html#step-1-create-and-collect-credentials)
for more information about how to generate these.


```puppet
node 'broker1.example.com' {
  # Please see
  # https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mcollective/blob/master/examples/mco_profile/manifests/middleware/activemq.pp
  # for this as setting up activemq with a truststore can be quite complex.
}

node 'server1.example.com' {
  class { '::mcollective':
    middleware_hosts    => [ 'broker1.example.com' ],
    middleware_ssl      => true,
    middleware_ssl_cert => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/${::clientcert}.pem",
    middleware_ssl_key  => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/${::clientcert}.pem",
    middleware_ssl_ca   => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem",
    securityprovider    => 'ssl',
    ssl_client_certs    => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/client_certs',
    ssl_ca_cert         => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/certs/ca.pem',
    ssl_server_public   => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/certs/server.pem',
    ssl_server_private  => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/private_keys/server.pem',
  }

  mcollective::actionpolicy { 'nrpe':
    default => 'deny',
  }

  mcollective::actionpolicy::rule { 'vagrant user can use nrpe agent':
    agent    => 'nrpe',
    callerid => 'cert=vagrant',
  }
}

node 'control.example.com' {
  class { '::mcollective':
    client              => true,
    middleware_hosts    => [ 'broker1.example.com' ],
    middleware_ssl      => true,
    middleware_ssl_cert => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/${::clientcert}.pem",
    middleware_ssl_key  => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/private_keys/${::clientcert}.pem",
    middleware_ssl_ca   => "/var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem",
    securityprovider    => 'ssl',
    ssl_client_certs    => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/client_certs',
    ssl_ca_cert         => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/certs/ca.pem',
    ssl_server_public   => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/certs/server.pem',
    ssl_server_private  => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/private_keys/server.pem',
  }

  mcollective::user { 'vagrant':
    certificate => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/client_certs/vagrant.pem',
    private_key => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/private_keys/vagrant.pem',
  }
}
```

### The `::mcollective::` class

and by the 'ssl' securityprovider to sign messages as from this user.

### `mcollective::plugin` defined type

`mcollective::plugin` installs a plugin from a source uri or a package.  When
installing from a source uri the plugin will be copied to
`mcollective::site_libdir`

```puppet
mcollective::plugin { 'puppet':
  package => true,
}
```

When installing a plugin from source you need to create the correct directory
structure for it to work.

For example if you wish to sync an agent for apt which ships with ``apt.ddl``
and ``apt.rb`` you need to create the following structure:

```
site_mcollective/files/plugins/apt/
                               └── mcollective
                                   └── agent
                                       ├── apt.ddl
                                       └── apt.rb
```

Now you can then point the ``source`` attribute of the defined type to the
apt folder in your plugins directory.

```puppet
mcollective::plugin { 'apt':
  source => 'puppet:///modules/site_mcollective/plugins/apt',
}
```

For more examples have a look at the directory structure in ``files/plugins``
of this module.

#### Parameters

##### `name`

String: the resource title.  The base name of the plugin to install.

##### `source`

String: will default to "puppet:///modules/mcollective/plugins/${name}".  The
source uri that will be copied to `mcollective::site_libdir`

##### `package`

Boolean: defaults to false.  Whether to install the plugin from a file copy or
a package install.

##### `type`

String: defaults to 'agent'.  The type of the plugin package to install.

##### `has_client`

Boolean: defaults to true.  When installing from a package, whether to attempt
to install `mcollective-${name}-client` on the client node.

### `mcollective::actionpolicy` defined type

`mcollective::actionpolicy` configures an agent for use with actionpolicy in
conjunction with `mcollective::actionpolicy::rule`.

#### Parameters

##### `name`

String: the resource title.  The name of the agent to set up an actionpolicy
for.

##### `default`

String: defaults to 'deny'.  The default actionpolicy to apply to the agent.

### `mcollective::actionpolicy::rule` defined type

`mcollective::actionpolicy::rule` represents a single actionpolicy policy
entry. See the actionpolicy plugin [Policy File Format](https://github.com/puppetlabs/mcollective-actionpolicy-auth#policy-file-format)
for specific restrictions on the values of these fields.

#### Parameters

##### `name`

String: the resource title.  A descriptive name for the rule you are adding.

##### `agent`

String: required, no default.  The name of the agent you are adding a rule
for.

##### `action`

String: defaults to 'allow'.  What to do when the other conditions of this
line are matched.

##### `callerid`

String: defaults to '*'.  What callerids should match this rule.

##### `actions`

String: defaults to '*'.  What actions should match this rule.

##### `fact_filter`

String: defaults to '*'.  What facts should match this rule. This can be either
'*', a space-separated list of ``fact=value`` pairs (which match if every listed
fact matches), or any valid [compound filter string](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/reference/basic/basic_cli_usage.html#complex-compound-or-select-queries). This matches the "facts" field of the policy file lines.

##### `classes`

String: defaults to '*'.  What classes should match this rule.

### `mcollective::common::setting` defined type

`mcollective::common::setting` declares a setting that is common between
server and client.

#### Parameters

##### `setting`

String: defaults to the resource title.  The name of the setting to set.

##### `value`

String: no default.  The value to set.

##### `order`

String: default '10'.  The order in which to merge this setting.

### `mcollective::server::setting` defined type

`mcollective::server::setting` declares a setting that is exclusive to a server.

#### Parameters

##### `setting`

String: defaults to the resource title.  The name of the setting to set.

##### `value`

String: no default.  The value to set.

##### `order`

String: default '30'.  The order in which to merge this setting.

### `mcollective::client::setting` defined type

`mcollective::client::setting` declares a setting that is common to clients
and users.

#### Parameters

##### `setting`

String: defaults to the resource title.  The name of the setting to set.

##### `value`

String: no default.  The value to set.

##### `order`

String: default '30'.  The order in which to merge this setting.

### `mcollective::user::setting` defined type

`mcollective::user::setting` declares a setting that is specific to a user.

#### Parameters

##### `username`

String: required, no default.  Which user to set this value for.

##### `setting`

String: required, no default. The name of the setting to set.

##### `value`

String: no default.  The value to set.

##### `order`

String: default '70'.  The order in which to merge this setting.

### `mcollective::server::config::factsource::yaml` private class

`mcollective::server::config::factsource::yaml` is the class that implements cron-based fact generation and configures MCollective to use it. It is a private class and so may not be declared directly, but rather is invoked when the `mcollective` class is declared with the `factsource` parameter set to `yaml` (the default). Although `mcollective::server::config::factsource::yaml` is private it does have one parameter which can be tuned using data bindings (e.g. Hiera).

#### Parameters

##### `path`

String: default $::path. What PATH environment variable to use when refresh-mcollective-metadata is invoked by cron.

## Reference

### Configuration merging

The configuration of the server and client are built up from the various calls
to `mcollective::common::setting`, `mcollective::server::setting`,
`mcollective::client::setting`, and `mcollective::user::setting`.

Settings for the server will be a merge of `mcollective::common::setting` and
`mcollective::server::setting`, highest order of the setting wins.

Settings for the client will be a merge of `mcollective::common::setting`,
and `mcollective::client::setting`, highest order of the setting wins.

Settings for a specific user will be a merge of
`mcollective::common::setting`, `mcollective::client::setting` and
`mcollective::user::setting` for that specific user, highest order of setting
wins.

#### Overriding existing options

You can override an existing server setting from outside of the module by
simply specifying that setting again with a higher order than the default of
that type, for example to make a server's loglevel be debug (without simply
setting mcollective::server_loglevel) you could write:

```puppet
mcollective::server::setting { 'override loglevel':
  setting => 'loglevel',
  value   => 'debug',
  order   => '50',
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why do I have no client.cfg?

I said to install the client, so why when I run `mco ping` am I seeing this:

```shell
$ mco ping
Failed to generate application list: RuntimeError: Cannot find config file '/etc/mcollective/client.cfg'
```

You've enabled the ssl security provider, which implies each user will have
their own ssl credentials to use in the collective.  In order to avoid
incomplete configuration of clients in this mode we delete the system-wide
/etc/mcollective/client.cfg and only generate user configuration files with
the `mcollective::user` definition.

## Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 3.0 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* CentOS 6
* Ubuntu 12.04

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed.

## Development

Puppet Community modules on are open projects, and community contributions are
essential for keeping them great. We can’t access the huge number of platforms
and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is
intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)
